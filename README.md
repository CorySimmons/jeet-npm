# Jeet-NPM

This package has been deprecated as a result of [Jeet](http://jeet.gs) turning exclusively into a grid system rather than continuing to slip into the monolithic path. Leaving it here for archeology purposes. Check out the new Jeet at [http://github.com/mojotech/jeet](http://github.com/mojotech/jeet).

Parts of this repo have been broken out into smaller packages that integrate nicely with Jeet. You can find them in the following places:
- [Boy](http://github.com/corysimmons/boy) - A lightweight, modern, HTML5 Boilerplate fork with conditionally loaded polyfills for amazing browser support back to IE7
- [Typographic](https://github.com/corysimmons/typographic) - Stylus typography with modular scale, font stacks, and more
- [Watchel](https://github.com/corysimmons/watchel) - [WIP] Auto watch/compilation/LiveReload for a myriad of frontend languages
